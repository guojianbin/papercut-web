Installation Note:

Installation is copy and paste. Incoming messages are written to the start-up directory of Papercut. If you do not have write permission to that directory by default, you will either need to either:
Run Papercut with elevated (aka Administrator) permissions.
Run the app in a directory in which you have write permission (e.g. Desktop).
